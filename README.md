# AWSKeyManager
Manage your AWS Keys in ~/.aws/credentials with a CLI UI. This currently supports switching your default key, adding, and deleting keys.


# Building
The easiest way to use this is to run the build script at the root. It'll currently create a linux and darwin executables.

# Using
After building, copy the file to a location in your $PATH. Run `$PATH/akm` and have the menu guide you. You can:
1. Set a default key
2. Delete a key
3. Add a new key
